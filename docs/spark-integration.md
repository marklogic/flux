Flux can be used with an existing [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) cluster to support large workloads that
require more system resources than what are available when running Flux as a command line application.

## Spark security notice

As of August 2024 and the Flux 1.0.0 release, all public releases of Apache Spark 3.4.x through 3.5.1 depend on 
Apache Hadoop 3.3.4. This version of Hadoop has a 
[CVE filed against it](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-26031). The CVE involves Spark running with a 
YARN cluster manager and the YARN cluster "is accepting work from remote (authenticated) users". 

For normal Flux CLI usage, this CVE is a false positive as Flux does not use a YARN cluster manager. Flux uses 
Spark's standalone cluster manager by default - see the 
[Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/cluster-overview.html) for further information on Spark
cluster managers. 

If you use Flux with the Apache Spark `spark-submit` program as described below, you should consider the above CVE if
you are also running a YARN cluster manager. In this scenario, you have full control and responsibility over your 
Spark cluster, as Flux does not include any Spark or Hadoop packages when it is used with `spark-submit`.

## Submitting Flux commands

Flux integrates with [spark-submit](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html) to allow you to 
submit a Flux command invocation to a remote Spark cluster. Every Flux command is a Spark application, and thus every
Flux command, along with all of its option, can be invoked via `spark-submit`. 

To use Flux with `spark-submit`, first download the `marklogic-flux-1.0.0-all.jar` file from the 
[GitHub release page](https://github.com/marklogic/flux/releases/tag/1.0.0). This jar file includes Flux and all of 
its dependencies, excluding those of Spark itself, which will be provided via the Spark cluster that you connect to 
via `spark-submit`. 

You can now run any Flux command with `spark-submit`.  
The following shows a notional example of running the Flux `import-files` command:

{% tabs log %}
{% tab log Unix %}
```
$SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --class com.marklogic.flux.spark.Submit \
    --master spark://changeme:7077 \
    marklogic-flux-1.0.0-all.jar \
    import-files \
    --path path/to/data \
    --connection-string user:password@host:8000 \
    --preview 10
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab log Windows %}
```
$SPARK_HOME\bin\spark-submit --class com.marklogic.flux.spark.Submit ^
    --master spark://changeme:7077 ^
    marklogic-flux-1.0.0-all.jar ^
    import-files ^
    --path path/to/data ^
    --connection-string user:password@host:8000 ^
    --preview 10
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Key points on the above example:

1. You must provide a value of `com.marklogic.flux.spark.Submit` for the required `--class` option. This class 
provides the entry point that allows for a Flux command to be run.
2. Set the value of `--master` to the master URL of your Spark cluster.
3. As noted in the [Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html), the path
to the Flux jar - the "application jar" - must be globally visible inside your cluster.
4. The "application arguments" consist of the name of the Flux command and the options you provide to that command. 


### Accessing S3 with spark-submit

If you wish to run a Flux command that accesses an S3 path, you must use the `--packages` option with `spark-submit`
to include the necessary dependencies to allow for Spark to access S3, as shown below:

    --packages org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-aws:3.3.4,org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-client:3.3.4

The above packages are not included in the Flux jar file, as the version required by your Spark cluster may differ.

### Using Avro data with spark-submit

Per the [Spark Avro documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-data-sources-avro.html), the `spark-avro`
dependency is not included in Spark by default. If you wish to run either `import-avro-files` or `export-avro-files`
with Flux and `spark-submit`, you must include the following line in your `spark-submit` invocation:

    --packages org.apache.spark:spark-avro_2.12:3.4.3

You should change the version number of this dependency to match that of your Spark cluster.

## Configuring Spark for local usage

When Flux is run via the command line, it creates a temporary local Spark cluster with a Spark master URL of 
`local[*]`. You can adjust this via the `--spark-master-url` option. Typically, this will involve still creating a 
local Spark cluster but with different settings. If you wish to connect to a remote Spark cluster, you will most likely
want to use `spark-submit` as described above.
