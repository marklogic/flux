Flux can import a variety of RDF files in a fashion similar to that of 
[MarkLogic Content Pump](https://docs.marklogic.com/11.0/guide/mlcp-guide/en/importing-content-into-marklogic-server/loading-triples.html).

## Usage

The `import-rdf-files` command reads RDF data from a variety of RDF file types and writes one or more 
[managed triples documents](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/semantics/loading) in MarkLogic. 
Each managed triples document is an XML document containing up to 100 semantic triples. 

To import RDF files, you must specify at least one `--path` option along with connection information for the MarkLogic 
database you wish to write to:

{% tabs log %}
{% tab log Unix %}
```
./bin/flux import-rdf-files \
    --path /path/to/files \
    --connection-string "flux-example-user:password@localhost:8004" \
    --permissions flux-example-role,read,flux-example-role,update
```
{% endtab %}
{% tab log Windows %}
```
bin\flux import-rdf-files ^
    --path path\to\files ^
    --connection-string "flux-example-user:password@localhost:8004" ^
    --permissions flux-example-role,read,flux-example-role,update
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}


## Supported files types

Flux supports the same [RDF data formats](https://docs.marklogic.com/guide/semantics/loading#id_70682) as
MarkLogic server does, which are listed below:

| Format  | File Extension | 
|---------|----------------|
| RDF/XML | .rdf or .xml |
| RDF/JSON | .json |
| N3 | .n3 | 
| N-Quads | .nq |
| N-Triples | .nt |
| TriG | .trig | 
| Turtle | .ttl |

Flux will attempt to load each file specified via `--path` by determining the format of the RDF data based on the 
file extension.

## Specifying a graph

By default, every triple loaded into MarkLogic will be added to the default MarkLogic semantic graph of 
`http://marklogic.com/semantics#default-graph`. Each RDF quad is loaded into the graph specified within the quad.

To specify a different graph for every triple, use the `--graph` option. This option only affects triples and not quads. 

To specify a graph for both triples and quads - thus overriding the graph associated with each quad - use the 
`--graph-override` option. 

Note that the set of collections specified via the `--collections` option does not have any impact on the graph. You 
are free to specify as many collections as you want in addition to the graph you choose via `--graph` or 
`--graph-override`. 

## Compressed files

Flux supports Gzip and ZIP RDF files. Simply include the `--compression` option with a value of `GZIP` or `ZIP`.
