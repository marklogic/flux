Flux supports importing data from files in a variety of formats from a local filesystem, Amazon S3, or Azure Storage, 
as well as from data sources that are accessible via a [JDBC driver](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jdbc/basics/index.html), including those supported by 
[Postgres Data Direct JDBC drivers](https://www.progress.com/jdbc).
