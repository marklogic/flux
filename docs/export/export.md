Flux can export data from MarkLogic as documents, rows, or RDF triples. Data can be written in a variety of file 
formats to a local filesystem, Amazon S3, or Azure Storage, or to another database via JDBC. Documents can also be exported to ZIP files - known as "archive" files - 
that contain both documents and their MarkLogic metadata.
